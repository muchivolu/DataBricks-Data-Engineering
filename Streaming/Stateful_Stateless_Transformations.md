In Spark Structured Streaming, the concepts of stateful and stateless transformations refer to how data is processed in relation to the accumulation and management of state over time. Understanding the differences between the two is crucial for designing efficient streaming applications.

𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Stateless transformations are operations that do not maintain any state information between batches of streaming data. Each batch is processed independently of previous or future batches.
𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬:
𝐍𝐨 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚: The processing of each batch does not depend on past data; each batch is treated as a separate entity.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬: Common stateless transformations include operations like map, filter, flatMap, and select.
𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞:Generally more performant since they don’t require additional overhead for maintaining state. Each batch is processed quickly as it doesn’t have to manage any historical data.

𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Stateful transformations are operations that maintain state information across batches. They can aggregate or process data over a period of time, utilizing information from previous batches.
𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬:
𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: These transformations can store and update intermediate results, requiring additional resources to manage state.
𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬: Common stateful transformations include operations like groupByKey, reduceByKey, updateStateByKey, and windowing operations (like groupBy(window(...))).
𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚: Stateful transformations can manage late data through mechanisms like watermarks, which allows them to discard or update state based on late arrivals.
